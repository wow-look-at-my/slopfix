// Package askproperly is a Claude Code MessageDisplay hook. It marks a closing
// message that hands the user a decision in prose, by appending a line to
// what the reader sees. It sends NOTHING back to the model.
//
// A question typed into a closing message is a decision handed back. The user
// has to read it, work out which options were meant, and type an answer -- and
// a model that can do this can offload any hard call it was asked to make.
// AskUserQuestion exists for exactly this: it renders the choices, so the user
// picks instead of composing a reply, and the model has to have thought the
// options through well enough to write them down.
//
// It was a Stop hook, and that was wrong the same way the sibling
// link-all-refs plugin's Stop hook was wrong. A Stop hook runs AFTER the
// message has streamed, so refusing cannot unsend anything: the user reads the
// prose question, then reads a near-identical retype of the same message. The
// retype explains itself, which puts the decision back into prose, so the guard
// fires again. That loop has no bound. The annotation goes to the reader
// instead, who is the person the question was aimed at.
//
// displayContent is display-only, read out of the shipped bundle rather than
// assumed: it "replaces the delta on screen without changing the stored
// message", and it is the only field the event's output schema carries.
//
// Every failure path prints nothing, which leaves the CLI showing the original
// text. This runs in the render path, and a guard that can eat output is worse
// than no guard.
