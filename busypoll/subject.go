// subject.go answers two questions about a tool call: is it a status read,
// and what is it a status read ABOUT.
//
// The subject is what makes this half work where the Stop half's signature
// comparison does not. A session that asks the same question four different
// ways -- `gh wait-ci`, then `gh wait-ci checks`, then `pull_request_read`,
// then `list_commits` -- produces four different signatures and no streak,
// while every call asks after the same pull request and learns the same
// nothing. Keying on the subject rather than the command text is what stops
// a re-spelling from laundering a repeat.
