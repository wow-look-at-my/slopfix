// display.go rewrites a streaming message so every reference the reader might
// open arrives clickable.
//
// This is the whole enforcement. There is no Stop hook and nothing is sent back
// to the model, because a missing link is not work only the model can do: the
// token plus the checkout determine the URL, so the hook writes it. Asking the
// model to re-emit the same message with a link in it costs a round trip, and
// the message it writes to comply names the reference again while explaining
// itself, which trips the guard a second time. What the user reads at the end of
// that is a reply carrying nothing but links.
//
// displayContent is display-only, verified against the shipped bundle: the
// transcript and the model's next request are both fed from an array that is
// populated BEFORE this hook runs and never updated from its result. So this
// changes what the reader sees and nothing else, which is exactly the surface
// the rule is about.
