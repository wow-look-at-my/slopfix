# auto-allow

`auto-allow` approves read-only work and refuses a program this environment does not run. The table is `autoallow/rules.xml`, embedded and checked by `rules.xsd`. MCP trust is per SERVER, not per tool-name pattern.

A rule with `wholeCommand="true"` refuses only a command that runs nothing else. The `true`, `false` and `:` rules work this way. A list that holds real work is never refused for a no-op inside it, because clean-bash repairs that list. A `while` loop on a bare `true` or `:` waits like `until`, and the `until` rule refuses it.

The binary is registered on PermissionRequest and PreToolUse. In `cli.js` (checked at `2.1.220`), `createCanUseTool` evaluates the rules first. PermissionRequest hooks run only on the "ask" path. `defaultMode: "auto"` answers first. A deny that rides PermissionRequest thus never fires in auto mode.

PreToolUse fires before the permission pipeline, whatever its outcome. A deny there stops the tool. The reason reaches the model as an error result. Deny therefore rides PreToolUse. Allow rides PermissionRequest, where it never outranks the user. `denyOnly` in `run.go` drops every non-deny verdict on PreToolUse.

The events want different output objects. `decisionPayload` therefore branches on the event. The verdict comes from `tool_input` alone. A call judged on both events is therefore harmless.

`rules.xml` has no `<mcpServer name="Claude_Code_Remote">` block, on purpose. Do not add one. The CCR proxy answers a call with `-32003` ("needs_approval"). The client then shows an approval card and runs the hooks beside it. A hook allow calls `cancelRequest`, which kills the card and the listener that a human click resolves through. The single retry carries no grant.

The model then sees `MCP error -32003: MCP tool call requires approval`.

Nothing else automates the click. The retry hands `canUseTool` a prebuilt `ask` decision. No rule, mode or classifier runs. `extraAllowedTools` does not exist in the bundle. `serverApprovalWatch` is the shape of a real upstream fix. `anthropics/claude-code#81362` tracks it.

Without `send_later`, use the `/loop` skill. Watch a pull request with `mcp__github__subscribe_pr_activity`.
