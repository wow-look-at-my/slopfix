# The decision model

## The invariant

Content that exists only in the working tree -- modified but uncommitted, or untracked -- must never be lost by a command the agent runs.

Everything else is subordinate to that. Committed work is reachable from the reflog for weeks, so a command that only rewrites committed history is not this plugin's problem.

## Preserve, then allow

The invariant is about the content, not about the command. The ordinary dirty-tree case is the tracked, untracked and ignored hazard below. The hook satisfies the invariant there directly instead of refusing. It commits the at-risk paths onto the CURRENT BRANCH. A ref no ordinary command shows is a ref nobody reviews and the next session deletes. So the commit goes where the log, the diff and the next push already look. Every step runs against a throwaway `GIT_INDEX_FILE`. The user's own index is never written and the working tree is never touched. `git read-tree HEAD` seeds that temp index with the last committed tree. It is skipped when no HEAD exists yet. The commit then gets no parent.

Two commits can come out of it, because a file holds one thing in HEAD, another in the index and a third on disk. `stagedTree` copies the at-risk paths' INDEX entries into the temp index first and writes a tree. `git add --force` then overwrites them with the working-tree content and writes a second. A tree equal to the one below it is dropped. The ordinary case therefore makes exactly one commit and never writes an empty one. `git update-ref HEAD` advances the branch. `git reset -q <commit> -- <paths>` refreshes the real index for those paths alone. Without it the tree reads as a staged revert of what was just saved. A best-effort `git push origin HEAD` gets the content off the machine. A push failure still allows, because the local commit satisfies the invariant on its own. The line that reports this says the push failed and where the content sits instead.

Content that was uncommitted before the hook ran is committed after it. So `git status` stops reporting the paths it saved. That is the mechanism working rather than a side effect to remove. Everything else must read exactly as it did. A file staged elsewhere keeps its staged blob and its `diff --cached` entry, and no byte on disk moves. `preserve_test.go` pins both halves.

Once that commit exists, the destructive command is safe by construction -- there is nothing left to refuse. The case that still denies is the commit itself failing. Preservation that did not happen must never read as success. A failed `git add`, `write-tree`, `commit-tree` or `update-ref` therefore falls back to the ordinary denial below.

Two hazard classes are deliberately excluded from this and still deny outright: a stash entry, and anything ref-destroying (the whole "reachability, not refusal" family below). Both ask a different question than "is there uncommitted work". Folding a stash pop or a synthesized ref into the same machinery is not worth the complexity here. `preserve_test.go`'s negative controls pin this as a stated boundary, not an oversight to fix later.

A preservation ref is the ONLY copy of what it holds. So it gets the opposite treatment from every other ref-destroying command. `git update-ref -d`, and a force-pushing or deleting `git push` that names one under `refs/no-work-loss/`, are refused unconditionally. That skips the "does it exist somewhere else" question entirely, because the ref itself contains the content and the answer is wrongly yes. `git branch -D` cannot reach this prefix at all: a branch name always resolves under `refs/heads/`.

Destruction and provenance are separate halves. See the provenance section in the top-level CLAUDE.md. A command a provenance rule denies for its own reasons still ends up denied after preservation: `git reset --hard`, `tee`, `truncate`, a truncating redirect. The preservation commit is then a harmless, redundant local artifact, and its notice is never surfaced, because the command never proceeded.

## The incident this was built for

```sh
git checkout master             # a dirty tree silently rides along to master
git reset --hard origin/master  # ...and the edits are gone, with no reflog entry
```

Note the shape. The first command is individually reasonable and destroys nothing. It is what makes the second one lethal. A guard that only gated `reset --hard` will have watched this happen.

## Hazard classes, and why they are not one bit

The single most tempting simplification here is a boolean: is the tree dirty? It is wrong. It is the failure that gets a guard uninstalled. The verbs do not agree about what "dirty" means:

| Command          | tracked modifications | untracked files | ignored files | stash entries |
|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| `reset --hard`   | destroys              | spares          | spares        | spares        |
| `clean -fd`      | spares                | destroys        | spares        | spares        |
| `clean -fdx`     | spares                | destroys        | destroys      | spares        |
| `stash drop`     | spares                | spares          | spares        | destroys      |
| `checkout <ref>` | destroys              | spares          | spares        | spares        |

Both are false positives on the safe half of a legitimate command, and both teach the user that the guard is noise. So each verb is checked only against the classes it can actually reach. `TestResetHardSparesUntrackedFiles` and `TestCleanSparesTrackedModifications` pin the two halves.

## Commands that destroy refs: reachability, not refusal

A separate family destroys refs, commits or the reflog rather than working-tree content: `push --force`, `push --delete`, a `+refspec`, `branch -D`, `branch -M`, `reflog expire`, `reflog delete`, `update-ref -d`, `filter-branch`, `worktree remove --force`.

None of these is destructive on its own. So the question asked is not "is this verb dangerous" but **does this content exist anywhere else**:

| Verb | What must survive elsewhere | How it is answered |
|---|---|---|
| `branch -D` / `-M` | the branch tip | another ref contains it |
| `push --force` / `+refspec` | the remote-tracking tip | it is an ancestor of what is being pushed, or another ref contains it |
| `push --delete` | the remote-tracking tip | another ref contains it |
| `update-ref -d` | the ref's tip | another ref contains it |
| `filter-branch` | all of HEAD | `rev-list --count HEAD --not --remotes` is 0 |
| `reflog expire` / `delete` | nothing reflog-only | `fsck --unreachable --no-reflogs` finds no commit |
| `worktree remove --force` | that worktree's edits | its `status --porcelain` is empty |

Two facts here were established by running git, and both had already produced a wrong answer in a draft:

- **`--exclude` does not take a full refname.** For `--branches` and `--remotes` the pattern matches the name *without* the `refs/heads/` or `refs/remotes/` prefix. `--exclude=refs/heads/feature --branches` silently excludes nothing, so a branch holding the only copy of a commit reported "0 would be lost". A silent false negative is the worst outcome available here, which is why containment via `for-each-ref --contains` is used instead of hand-built exclusion lists.
- **`refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD` is a symbolic alias** for the branch being overwritten. Counting it as "somewhere else" made every force push look safe. It is filtered out explicitly.

`push --mirror` remains an unconditional refusal: it rewrites every ref at once, so there is no bounded set of commits whose survival can be checked. It is the only member of the family without a reachability answer.

When a push cannot be verified -- no remote-tracking ref exists locally -- the answer is deny, not allow. Absence of a local mirror is not evidence the remote is empty. The fix named in the denial is `git fetch`.

A force push judged safe is still judged against possibly-stale local knowledge of the remote, which is exactly what `--force-with-lease` exists to close. The denial path recommends it. The allow path cannot, since by then there is nothing to warn about.

## What is deliberately NOT blocked

- **Unpushed commits.** `git reset --hard origin/master` on a clean tree is allowed even when HEAD is ahead of upstream. Those commits are in the reflog. Blocking here will refuse a routine, reversible operation and buy nothing.
- Note that it cannot apply to the working tree. That is why the dirty-tree verbs stay state-based and the ref verbs are reachability-based. `git stash drop` sits with the former: stashing is precisely the act of putting content somewhere no branch points at.
- **`git checkout -b` / `git switch -c`.** Creating a branch carries changes across. It cannot drop them. Dirty or not, allowed.
- **`git stash push`, `git commit`, `git add`.** These create recovery. `stash push` is also the suggested fix in most denials, so blocking it will make the guard unescapable.
- **`git restore --staged`** without `--worktree`: it rewrites the index from HEAD and leaves the file on disk, so the content survives.
- **Read-only verbs, and unknown verbs.** Only destructive verbs are enumerated. Everything else falls through to allow, so `git status` costs one substring scan and a new git subcommand does not arrive pre-blocked.
- **Appending.** `>>`, `tee -a`, and `git rm --cached` all leave content in place.
- **Anything outside a git repository.** There is no uncommitted work to lose, and policing a user's whole filesystem is not this plugin's job.

## Detection

Substring matching on `git reset --hard` is not sufficient and gives false confidence.

- **Chains.** `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`, newlines, brace blocks, subshells, `if`/`while`/`for`/`case` bodies, function bodies, and command substitutions. Each is evaluated on its own.
- **Working directory.** A `cd` is tracked across the sequence, so `cd /other/repo && git reset --hard` is checked against `/other/repo`. The cwd pointer is shared only where the shell shares one: `&&`, `||`, `;` and brace blocks carry a `cd` forward. A pipe stage, a subshell and a conditional body each get a copy. `git -C <path>` and `--work-tree` are applied the same way.
- **Wrappers.** These all resolve to the same program: `env`, `sudo`, `doas`, `command`, `builtin`, `exec`, `nohup`. So do `nice`, `ionice`, `setsid`, `stdbuf`, `timeout`, `xargs`, a leading `\`, and an absolute path. Value-taking flags are understood. Otherwise `nice -n 10 git reset --hard` leaves `10` where the program must be, and the git behind it is never seen.
- **Flags.** Short flags are unbundled, so `-fdx`, `-xdf` and `-f -d -x` are the same command. `--flag=value` registers as `--flag`. `--` separates operands.
- **Aliases.** Resolved out of `git config --get-regexp '^alias\.'`, including the `!shell` form, which is re-parsed as shell. Builtin verbs skip the lookup entirely, since git refuses to let an alias shadow one. Chains resolve. Self-reference terminates at depth 3.

## Ambiguity resolves to denial

Three cases produce a denial without a state answer. A destructive verb whose target cannot be identified is what this plugin exists to refuse:

- The command does not parse **and** names a destructive verb. (Unparseable with nothing destructive in it is allowed.)
- An operand is not statically known -- `rm $TARGET`, `cd $DIR && git reset --hard`, `cd -`.
- `GIT_DIR` / `GIT_WORK_TREE` / `--git-dir` relocate the repository away from the path words. The target is no longer knowable.

A script FILE the walk follows as a new shell is the exception to all of it. Its variables, its working directory and the text it hands another shell are its own. This hook does not sandbox the programs it starts. A build script names its output from a variable. So an unresolvable operand, an unresolvable working directory and an unreadable inner shell are all out of scope inside one. A path the script names STATICALLY is still judged, so following a file still closes the write-elsewhere-then-run bypass. A blocker ABOUT the file, such as one that does not parse, still denies. It describes the command that named the file rather than the program inside it.

## A redirect has a descriptor as well as a target

Two redirect shapes cannot empty a file holding content no git object has. A device target swallows what it is given. `/dev/null`, `/dev/stdout`, `/dev/stderr`, `/dev/tty` and `/dev/fd/*` are all absolute, so no working directory is needed to resolve one. A descriptor other than stdout carries a stream rather than the command's output. The destruction half skips both. The provenance half judges every descriptor, because content reaching a file inside the tree is authored content whichever stream filled it. So `git status 2>/dev/null` runs and `echo x 2> tracked.go` is refused by name.

## Fail-safety, stated honestly

Inside the process, failure denies for destructive verbs. A panic is recovered and converted to a denial, a git subprocess that errors or exceeds the 3-second timeout produces "cannot tell whether ... would lose uncommitted work". An unreadable repository is never assumed clean. Everything non-destructive fails open. A bug here cannot brick a session.

So if the binary itself is killed or hangs past the harness timeout, the command proceeds. The internal 3-second git timeout exists to keep the process well inside that window so the deny path is reached rather than the harness's. A hook cannot make itself mandatory. This is a property of the platform, not something the plugin declines to handle.

## Cost

The prefilter is a substring scan for `git`, `rm`, `mv`, `>`, `tee`, `truncate`. Anything else returns before a parse and before any subprocess. Repository state is probed at most once per directory per invocation. `--ignored` and `stash list` are fetched only for the verbs that need them.

## Interaction with the sibling plugins

- Shell truncation (`>`, `tee`, `truncate -s 0`) is a Bash concern and is handled by this model.
- **`cleanup-bash-cmds`** rewrites `rm` into `recycler trash`. It does not make `rm` safe on its own: hooks receive the original input, so neither plugin can see the other's rewrite. This plugin therefore evaluates `rm` as written. Where both fire, the deny wins, which is the correct precedence.
